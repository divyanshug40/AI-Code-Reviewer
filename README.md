Python Code Reviewer
Introduction
The Python Code Reviewer is an easy-to-use web application powered by Streamlit and Google's Generative AI. This app assists users by reviewing Python code snippets, providing helpful feedback, identifying bugs, suggesting optimizations, and offering clear explanations in a user-friendly manner.

With this tool, you can quickly receive an automated review of your Python code. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, the app helps improve your coding by pointing out errors, inefficiencies, and ways to make your code cleaner and more efficient.

Features
Bug Detection: The app will automatically detect potential bugs and errors in the Python code.
Code Optimization: The reviewer will suggest areas where code can be optimized for better performance and readability.
Step-by-Step Explanation: Each bug fix or code improvement is accompanied by an explanation, making it easy to understand the changes.
Code Review in Real-Time: The app provides real-time feedback, allowing users to see and fix issues immediately.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive, with clear instructions and easy navigation.
How It Works
Input your Code: You can enter your Python code directly into the provided text area.
Click the "Review Code" Button: Once your code is ready, click the "Review Code" button. The AI-powered model will then analyze your code.
Review the Feedback: The app will present you with a detailed code review, pointing out any bugs or inefficiencies, and suggesting improvements.
Fixed Code and Explanation: Along with the review, the app provides a fixed version of your code and an explanation of the changes made.
Installation
To run this Python code review app locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Streamlit (for building the web interface)
Google Generative AI SDK (for code reviewing)
Step-by-Step Guide
Clone the Repository: If you are working with a version control system like Git, clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Python-Code-Reviewer.git
Install Dependencies: Install all required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Streamlit and google-generativeai in the requirements.txt file.

Set Up API Key: The app uses Google’s Generative AI API. Make sure you have a valid API key from Google’s platform. Set it up in the script as shown below:

python
Copy
ai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key.

Run the Application: Finally, run the Streamlit app using the following command:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
This will open the app in your browser where you can start testing it.

Code Breakdown
AI Configuration: The google.generativeai library is used to interact with the AI model. We use gemini as the language model for reviewing the Python code.

Streamlit UI: The app is built using Streamlit, which provides an interactive and visually appealing interface. It uses a text area where users can input their Python code and a button to trigger the review.

Code Review System Prompt: The system prompt defines the behavior of the AI. It focuses solely on reviewing Python code, identifying bugs, and providing optimized code along with clear explanations.

AI Review: The app calls the Google Gemini API to process the input Python code and generate detailed feedback. The output consists of:
